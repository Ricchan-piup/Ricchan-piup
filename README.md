- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ricchan-piup
- 👀 I’m interested in ... all sorts of things actually, programming, language learning, video-games, and recently got into psychology :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build all sort of software using flutter (and java at university). I've also been actively learning japanese for a few years now !
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games or game mods ! I'm in software engineering and would like to specialize in video game development.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm French but french is the language I've spoken the less for the past year 😎
